Description:
  - Clean blog is a coding blog site. I have made this site using HTML, CSS, JS and BootStrap for designing purpose. For backend development I have used python-flask. 
  - By using sqlalchemy for the database connection and data management. In the database posts and contact for issues details are stored. 
  - I have used Jinja templating for passing variables and accessing dynamic content on the static pages.
  - Here I have made a administrator account which is responsible for add, edit and delete blog posts. Only admin can add posts. 
  - If you want to publish your post you should contact with the admin. His/her dicision will be final decision whether to publish a blog or not.
